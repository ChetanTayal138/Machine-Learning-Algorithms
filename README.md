# Machine-Learning-Algorithms
Implementation of some machine learning algorithms from scratch using numpy.
The algorithms have been written in conjunction with the machine-learning coursera assignments for easier verifictation of predictions.
All of the Data and Weights for python can be obtained from https://github.com/dibgerge/ml-coursera-python-assignments
